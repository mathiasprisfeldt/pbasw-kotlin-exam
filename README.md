# pbasw-kotlin-exam
Short Kotlin web application made with Spring Boot.

<br>

## Features:
- Cookie based login system
- CRUD Articles
- Sequence calculator for math-tables
- REST API for the site features

<br>

## Goal:
The main focus was programming in Kotlin and make something usable, so the visual appearance is to be ignored.

<br>

## DISCLAIMER!
The site is quickly made and security was not a focus, even though i hash passwords the authentication for using the REST API is lacking, so please dont use any personal information in the demo.
